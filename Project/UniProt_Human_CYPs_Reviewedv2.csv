Converts arachidonic acid toward epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EpETrE) regioisomers, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15- EpETrE, that function as lipid mediators in the vascular system (PubMed:20972997). Additionally, displays dehydratase activity toward oxygenated eicosanoids hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoates (HpETEs). This activity is independent of cytochrome P450 reductase, NADPH, and O2 (PubMed:21068195).
